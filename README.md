## Project Overview
Welcome to our Library Management System, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline library operations. 
This web application is made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end interface, while Django powers 
the back-end services.

## User Roles and Features
The system serves two primary user roles: Students and Administrators.

### Students
Students can:

- Borrow and return books.
- Access a personal dashboard that maintains a record of their borrowed books and borrowing history.

### Admins
Admins are granted the permissions to:

- Add new students from the admin page.
- Add, remove, and edit book details.
- Manage authors, categories, and publishersâ€™ information.
